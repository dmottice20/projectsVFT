Stores my collection of GAMS, CPLEX, and AML files to analyze which algebraic modeling language is best for my career as a 15A in USAF.

Each sub folder will store the outputs and code of its respective GAMS, CPLEX, and AML. 

There will be an analysis folder that stores Python scripts and Jupyter notebook.
